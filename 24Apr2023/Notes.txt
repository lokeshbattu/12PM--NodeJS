Backend Development with Node, Express , MongoDB:

Introduction to NodeJS:

Node.js is a server side javascript runtime environment which provides the 
environment to run javascript apps on the server side. 

Node.js was implemented by Ryan while working on a java project. 

Web Site: https://nodejs.org/en

With node, we cannot develop applications.

Express.js framework is used to develop server side javascript applications and runs 
them on nodejs. 

History of NodeJS:

When Ryan was working on data intensive application. Java was used for that application. 

Ryan found few performance issues with Java w.r.t data intensive applications and decided 
to provide some solution through a javascript runtime engine and then developed Node.js

May 27, 2009 is when the initial release on Node.JS.

Stable version: April 18, 2023 

Since Node.js is an opensource application, hence there are lot of users started using 
Node.js.

It was written C, C++, JavaScript.

Corporate users of Node.js software include GoDaddy,[10] Groupon,[11] IBM,[12] LinkedIn,[13][14] Microsoft,[15][16] Netflix,[17] PayPal,[18][19] SAP,[20] Walmart,[21] Yahoo!,[22] and Amazon Web Services.[23]

Features of NodeJS:

1. light weight and uses Google Chrome's V8 engine.

2. Its open source, we can even customize node.js based on our requirement. 

3. It can run any kind of server side js application (expressjs, next.js).

4. High Performance 

5. Large community 

6. Node.js is Single Threaded, event driven and aysnc runtime environment. 

Dahl criticized the limited possibilities of the most popular web server in 2009, Apache HTTP Server,
 to handle a lot of concurrent connections (up to 10,000 and more) and the most common way of creating code (sequential programming), 
when code either blocked the entire process or implied multiple execution stacks in the case of simultaneous connections.
